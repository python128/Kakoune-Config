# Kakoune-Config
My Kakoune text editor's .config file

## Changes
- I have made <ret> key to write the file (in normal mode), and <c-q> to quit.
- Made scrolloff to 2, 5.
- Made all spaces as tabs, and each tab is of 4 spaces width.
- It is based on Powerline.
  
## Credits
Special thanks to andreyorst's powerline.kak, and some other changes.
