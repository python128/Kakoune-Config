# Kakoune-Config ![alt text](Kakoune.jfif)
My Kakoune text editor's config file(kakrc)

## Changes
- I have made <ret> key to write the file (in normal mode), and <c-q> to quit.
- Made scrolloff to 2, 5.
- Made all spaces as tabs, and each tab is of 4 spaces width.
- It is based on Powerline.
- Current colorscheme is `desertex`
